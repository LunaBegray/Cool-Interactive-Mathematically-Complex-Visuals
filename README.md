# Sand Pendulum Art

A simple Pygame-based simulation of a pendulum with sand particles. The pendulum swings, leaving a trail of sand particles that move off the screen. The speed of the sand particles can be adjusted in real-time using a slider at the bottom of the window.

## Features:
- Pendulum motion based on simple physics.
- Real-time generation of sand particles at the pendulum's tip.
- Adjustable sand speed via an interactive slider.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- pygame_gui

## Running the Project:
1. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame pygame_gui
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
